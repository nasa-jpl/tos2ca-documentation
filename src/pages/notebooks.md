# Jupyter Notebook Examples

The TOS2CA team has created a few examples of how to use data produced by the system.  These show how to plot data, using our interpolated files.

These examples are hosted through [Binder](https://mybinder.org) and are free to use.  Note that sometimes, they might take a while to load.  If they produce an error in loading, try refreshing the page in your browser.
