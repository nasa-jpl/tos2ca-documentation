# Documentation
This documentation website is built on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) v3.4.  Information here is meant to give an overview of the TOS2CA project and its Git repositories.

## Deployment
Use Node Package Manager (NPM) v10.5.0 or higher to run:

```npm run build```

Which will build all the static pages.  You can then point your webserver to the ```/build``` directory.
